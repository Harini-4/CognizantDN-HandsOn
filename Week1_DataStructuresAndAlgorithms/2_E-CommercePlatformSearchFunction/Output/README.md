## Big O Notation

**Linear Search:**
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average Case: O(n)
- Worst Case: O(n)

**Binary Search:**
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average Case: O(log n)
- Worst Case: O(log n)

---

## Time Complexity

- **Linear Search**: `O(n)` – simple, works on unsorted data.
- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)` – much faster, but requires sorted data.

## Conclusion

For large e-commerce platforms, **Binary Search** is more efficient due to faster performance — ideal when products are sorted.
